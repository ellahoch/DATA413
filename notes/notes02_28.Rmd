do `usethis::create_package(rstudio = F)` to create package

@export says to add to package

devtools::install() to install package like normal

- or devtools::load_all() to put in memory only for the session (dont do that)

devtools::check() does some checks on the package

after installing and loading run `usethis::usethistest()` to test package again

usethis::use_test() to create tests

- then edit to add tests

- can expect_error or expect_equal whatever pops up 

Have to specify all packages with :: in a package
